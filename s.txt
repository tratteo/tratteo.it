 My path began in a pretty standard way. I studied Computer Engineering and then Computer Science. I easily landed a job in a big corporate months before graduating, I was excited and happy to be thrown into the real world. However, my expectation were actually in conflict with my nature. Since the first day at my new job, I felt something was off, things were not as I imagined, suddenly I did not felt the protagonist of my own life anymore. After less than 3 months, I got offered an important remote position in an American startup, I immediately quitted my corporate job and grasped this opportunity. This new job was better aligned with my identity, yet I still felt something was missing. During this period, I founded a startup with a close friend of mine. This was the spark that I needed: I understood that my path was different, I wanted to live a life at its fullest, I wanted to be the main protagonist of my life. For the second time in less than a year, I decided to quit my job to dedicate all my time to my startup, to what I have created and to what I will create in the future.
 Summing up, I build stuff that I love ðŸ—¿
